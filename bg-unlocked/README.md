# RP & Min-Max

This mod allows you to freely choose the race and culture you want without having to worry about min-max'ing your attributes by;

* removing the attribute bonuses you get from race and culture,
* increasing the amount of spendable attribute points from 15 to 18,
* increasing the maximum points you can have in an attribute from 18 to 20,
* increasing the maximum number of points apart any two attributes can be from 14 to 16 (so you can have an attribute at 3 and another at 20).


These changes override the defaults from ﻿﻿characters.gamedatabundle file.

There is an optional version which also unlocks all backgrounds, inspired by Nizzy's Backgrounds Unlocked mod.﻿
Use only one version at a time for stability reasons.

The idea and request belongs to u/mporubca on r/projecteternity.
